# google-voice-numbers
Retrieves the full list of available Google Voice numbers and finds the best ones

# TODO
- Need to setup rate limits as Google blocks you after X requests.
- If we had a centralized db, with decentralized users, this would limit the X of pointless requests (unless they are reverifying a phone number).
- This is kind of like using a Rainbow Table instead of using brute force.
